# AI-Virtual-click-CV-
This code is the Virtual Mouse project, which is considered a unique project because it combines hand tracking with actual control of the system (mouse).

# General idea:

-The code turns the camera into a virtual mouse.

-Move your finger (index finger) in front of the camera → the mouse pointer moves on the screen.

-If you bring your index and middle fingers together → it works as a click.
